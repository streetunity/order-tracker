# Measurement Feature Implementation Guide

## Overview
This feature adds always-editable measurement fields (height, width, length, weight) to OrderItems that bypass the order lock system. This allows measurements to be updated even when an order is locked, which is practical for manufacturing workflows.

## Files Added/Modified in This Branch

### 1. Database Schema
- **File**: `api/prisma/schema.prisma`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added 8 new fields to OrderItem model (height, width, length, weight, measurementUnit, weightUnit, measuredAt, measuredBy)
  - Added new MeasurementAuditLog model for tracking measurement changes

### 2. Backend Endpoints
- **File**: `api/src/measurement-endpoints.js` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Contains all measurement-specific endpoints
- **Note**: These endpoints need to be manually added to your `api/src/index.js` file before `app.listen()`

### 3. Frontend Components
- **Files**: 
  - `web/components/MeasurementModal.jsx` (NEW)
  - `web/components/MeasurementModal.css` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Modal component for editing measurements on the board page

### 4. API Proxy Routes
- **Files**:
  - `web/app/api/orders/[orderId]/items/[itemId]/measurements/route.js` (NEW)
  - `web/app/api/orders/[orderId]/measurements/bulk/route.js` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Next.js API routes that proxy measurement requests to backend

### 5. Update Instructions
- **Files**:
  - `web/app/admin/board/MEASUREMENT_UPDATES.jsx` - Instructions for updating board page
  - `web/app/admin/orders/[id]/MEASUREMENT_SECTION.jsx` - Instructions for edit order page
  - `web/app/admin/orders/[id]/measurements.css` - CSS styles for measurements section

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Database Migration
```bash
cd api
npx prisma migrate dev --name add-measurement-fields
npx prisma generate
```

### Step 2: Backend Updates
1. Open `api/src/index.js`
2. Copy the contents from `api/src/measurement-endpoints.js`
3. Paste the endpoints before `app.listen()` in your index.js
4. Save and restart the backend server

### Step 3: Frontend - Board Page
1. Open `web/app/admin/board/page.jsx`
2. Follow the instructions in `MEASUREMENT_UPDATES.jsx`:
   - Add import for MeasurementModal
   - Add state variables
   - Add handler functions
   - Update item rendering to include measurement display
   - Add modal component at end of JSX
3. Add the CSS styles to your `board.css` file

### Step 4: Frontend - Edit Order Page
1. Open `web/app/admin/orders/[id]/page.jsx`
2. Follow the instructions in `MEASUREMENT_SECTION.jsx`:
   - Add state variables
   - Initialize measurements in useEffect
   - Add handler functions
   - Add measurements section JSX after items table
3. Import the measurements.css file or add styles to existing CSS

### Step 5: Test the Feature
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd api
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd web
npm run dev
```

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Can add measurements to items via modal on board page
- [ ] Can edit measurements in bulk on edit order page
- [ ] Measurements save correctly to database
- [ ] Units (in/cm, lbs/kg) persist correctly
- [ ] Last measured date and user show correctly

### Lock Bypass Testing
- [ ] Lock an order using existing lock feature
- [ ] Verify regular fields (customer info, quantities) cannot be edited
- [ ] Verify measurement fields CAN still be edited via modal
- [ ] Verify measurements section on edit page shows "Always Editable" badge
- [ ] Confirm measurement saves work on locked orders

### UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Modal opens and closes properly
- [ ] Measurement badges display correctly on board
- [ ] Edit page measurements table renders correctly
- [ ] Visual indicators clearly show measurements are always editable
- [ ] Error messages display appropriately

## Key Features

### Always Editable
- Measurements bypass the lock system completely
- Separate `/measurements` endpoint that never checks lock status
- Clear visual indicators showing these fields are special

### Audit Trail
- Every measurement change is logged in MeasurementAuditLog
- Tracks who made changes and when
- Old and new values are recorded

### Bulk Operations
- Edit page allows updating all items at once
- Board page has individual item editing via modal
- Bulk endpoint for efficiency

## API Endpoints Added

### Individual Measurement Update
```
PATCH /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/measurements
Body: { height, width, length, weight, measurementUnit, weightUnit }
```

### Measurement History
```
GET /orders/:orderId/items/:itemId/measurement-history
Returns: Array of measurement changes
```

### Bulk Measurement Update
```
PATCH /orders/:orderId/measurements/bulk
Body: { items: [{id, height, width, length, weight}], measurementUnit, weightUnit }
```

## Design Decisions

### Why Bypass Lock?
- Measurements often aren't known at order creation
- Need to be updated during manufacturing process
- Customer info and quantities should remain locked
- Practical for real-world manufacturing workflows

### Color Scheme
- Maintained existing dark grey theme (#1a1a1a, #2d2d2d, #383838)
- Red accent color (#ef4444) for primary actions
- No blue or green colors as requested

### User Experience
- Clear "Always Editable" badges
- Measurement icon (üìè) for easy identification
- Inline editing on edit page for efficiency
- Modal on board page for quick updates

## Rollback Instructions

If you need to rollback this feature:
1. Switch back to master branch: `git checkout master`
2. Or revert the merge commit if already merged
3. Run database migration rollback: `npx prisma migrate revert`

## Merge Instructions

To merge this feature into master:
```bash
git checkout master
git merge feature/add-measurements
cd api
npx prisma migrate deploy
npm run dev
```

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify all files are properly updated
3. Ensure database migration ran successfully
4. Check that measurement endpoints are added to index.js
5. Verify API proxy routes are in place

## Notes

- The measurement fields are Float type in database (supports decimals)
- Empty measurements can be cleared (set to null)
- Measurement history is kept indefinitely
- Frontend validates numeric input only
- Backend handles string to float conversion

## ⚡ Quick Start (3 Manual Steps)

### Step 1: Pull Changes
```bash
cd /var/www/order-tracker
git pull origin aws-deployment
```

### Step 2: Edit `api/src/index.js` (2 small additions)

**A. Add import (line ~14):**
```javascript
import { createReportsRouter } from './routes/reports.js';
```

**B. Mount router (after `app.use(cookieParser());` line ~65):**
```javascript
// Reports Module
const reportsRouter = createReportsRouter(prisma);
app.use('/reports', authGuard, reportsRouter);
console.log('✅ Reports module loaded');
```

### Step 3: Add Navigation Link in `web/app/admin/board/page.jsx`

Find the `<nav className="headerNav">` section (~line 570) and add:
```javascript
<Link href="/admin/reports" className="btn">
  Reports
</Link>
```

### Step 4: Restart Everything
```bash
pm2 restart order-tracker-backend
cd web && npm run build && pm2 restart order-tracker-frontend
```

**Done!** Check logs for "✅ Reports module loaded"

## 🧪 Testing

After implementation, test these scenarios:

### Backend Tests
```bash
# Get auth token from browser localStorage
export TOKEN="your-jwt-token"

# Test summary
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/reports/summary

# Test cycle times
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:4000/reports/cycle-times?date_from=2025-01-01"

# Test admin-only (should fail if not admin)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/reports/sales-by-rep
```

### Frontend Tests
1. ✅ Click "Reports" button in navigation
2. ✅ See dashboard with KPIs
3. ✅ Click individual report
4. ✅ Change date filters
5. ✅ Verify data loads
6. ✅ Check pagination works
7. ✅ Verify colors are red/grey/black (no blue)
8. ✅ Test admin-only reports (login as admin)

---

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### "Cannot find module"
→ Run `git pull origin aws-deployment` and restart

### "404 Not Found"
→ Check `pm2 logs` - verify router is mounted correctly

### "No data in reports"
→ Check date filters and verify orders have required fields (`itemPrice`, `createdByUserId`)

### "Reports button doesn't show"
→ Rebuild frontend: `cd web && npm run build && pm2 restart order-tracker-frontend`

### "Blue colors showing"
→ Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear CSS cache

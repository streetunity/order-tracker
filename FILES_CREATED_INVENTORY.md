## How to Verify All Files Exist

Run this command to check:

```bash
cd /var/www/order-tracker

# Check backend files
ls api/src/utils/reportHelpers.js
ls api/src/routes/reports.js
ls api/src/routes/reportsCycleTime.js

# Check frontend files
ls web/app/admin/reports/page.jsx
ls web/app/admin/reports/reports.css
ls web/app/admin/reports/sales-by-rep/page.jsx
ls web/app/admin/reports/cycle-times/page.jsx

# Check documentation
ls REPORTS_README.md

ls QUICK_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md
```

All files should exist with no "No such file" errors.

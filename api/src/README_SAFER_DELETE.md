# Safer Delete Implementation

## Problem
The application was allowing deletion of customer accounts even when they had associated orders, which could lead to data integrity issues and orphaned orders.

## Solution
Implemented a safer deletion mechanism that:
1. Checks for associated orders before allowing customer deletion
2. Provides detailed error messages with order information if deletion is blocked
3. Only allows deletion when no orders exist for the customer

## Files
- `safer-delete.patch` - The complete safer delete endpoint implementation
- `apply-safer-delete.sh` - Shell script to automatically apply the patch
- `ACCOUNT_DELETE_PATCH.js` - Alternative patch file with the same implementation

## How to Apply

### Option 1: Manual Update
1. Open `api/src/index.js`
2. Find the DELETE /accounts/:id endpoint (around line 1537)
3. Replace the entire endpoint with the code from `safer-delete.patch`

### Option 2: Using the Script
```bash
cd api/src
chmod +x apply-safer-delete.sh
./apply-safer-delete.sh
```

## What Changed
The DELETE /accounts/:id endpoint now:
- First queries the account WITH its associated orders
- Checks if any orders exist
- If orders exist: Returns 400 error with details about the orders
- If no orders: Proceeds with deletion as normal
- Includes fallback handling for foreign key constraint errors

## Testing
1. Try to delete a customer with orders - should get error
2. Delete all orders for a customer
3. Try to delete the customer again - should succeed
